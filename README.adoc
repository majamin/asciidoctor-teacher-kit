This repo enables you to create:

* A base HTML/PDF of your notes and other teaching materials
* A handout version (by using the pre-processor `ifdef::handout`)
* A revealjs presentation of the file

In order to fully achieve the potential of this repo,
you'll want to be familiar with:

* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[Asciidoctor]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/reveal.js-converter/latest/[Asciidoctor-Revealjs]
* https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ_package[LaTeX tikz] syntax (for diagrams in tikz)

== A simple start

If you just want the simple stylesheet, without any of the extras,
you can simply just grab the stylesheet in `stylesheets/simple.css` and:

. Copy `simple.css` to the location of your `file.adoc`,
. Put `:stylesheet: simple.css` in your `file.adoc` file,
. Run `asciidoctor file.adoc`.

.Requirements
* `asciidoctor` executable

== Full start

`src/example.adoc` contains a comprehensive source file to create:

.Requirements
* `asciidoctor` executable
* `ruby` and ruby `bundle`
* chromium browser (to enable PDF generation)

. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/majamin/simple-asciidoctor-template`
. `cd simple-asciidoctor-template`
. `bundle install`
. `make`

Build files will compile in the `build` directory.

== Watch and show

If you're in a tmux session, running `watch-and-show.sh` can load a
nice dev environment, but is not necessary to be able to use this project.
Running the script creates new windows in the current session to be
able to monitor the live build and show.

.Requirements
* All of the above, and
* `browser-sync` and `nodemon` installed via npm,
* `tmux`

== Preview

See examples in the `examples` folder.
